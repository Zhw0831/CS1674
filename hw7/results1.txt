accuracy for full SPM = 0.5625

accuracy for level 0 = 0.3925

accuracy for level 1 = 0.5450

Based on above data, we can see that the accuracy of full SPM representation is the highest, and then level-1 histogram, and level-0 histogram is the worst. 

The full SPM has the highest accuracy because it combines the multiple levels so it can have more information and thus make better predictions. Similarly, the representation on level 1 is more detailed (since it concatenates 4 histograms while level 0 only has 1) than level 0, so the level 1 representation achieves a better result than level 0, but still not as detailed as the full one.
